        <h2 class="subtitle is-3" id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>

<p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.</p>

<p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>

  <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
  <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
  <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,

<h2 class="subtitle is-3" id="enforcement-responsibilities">Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.</p>

<p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle is-3" id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle is-3" id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.</p>

<p>All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle is-3" id="enforcement-guidelines">Enforcement Guidelines</h2>

<p>Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:</p>

<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle is-4" id="2-warning">2. Warning</h3>

<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels

permanent ban.</p>

<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public

private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle is-4" id="4-permanent-ban">4. Permanent Ban</h3>
